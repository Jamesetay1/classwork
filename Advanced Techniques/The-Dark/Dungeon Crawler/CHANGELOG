Assignment 1.01 - Dungeon Generation
1/20/18 -

Started the project.  Took a simple path to begin.
Created the 2D array that will be our dungeoun. 
Immediatley after created printMap() so that my dungeoun can be shown and I may debug easily.
Then created the rooms by printing '.' in a block and separated it, placing coridors in the separations.

TODO (Bug/Functionality) - Make the edges immutable.  I have been careful to avoid the edge and my PrintMap 
makes sure all that the edges are rocks, but they are not truly immutable.

1/21/18 - Fixed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 1.02 - Dungeon Save/Load

1/29/18 - Started with another students project 1.01 since mine was not very good and done lazily.
Began project 2 by creating all the switches and empty methods.  Began on the save method but
ran into an issue with not being able to find the proper file.  Always throws a seg fault.

TODO (BUG) - Fix the directory throwing a seg fault when writing.  As if it is really isn't opening the file.

1/30/18 - Fixed bug from last night, I just had the directory wrong.  I finished save and load functionality.
Got over a problem where when saving and the loading (the next call) your own - it would rarely get a bus error after
multiple calls, but would succeed on the next many times.  I tried this on multiple new saves,
and there was no more issues after a small fix.  However, it was a pretty rare bug.
I am willing to say this is fixed but I am not 100% guaranteeing it. If this happens just run it again. It will work.

BUG - When loading # towards the bottom, it will not always print them. But the rooms will always load.

Assignment 1.03 -- Weighted Paths

2/12/18 -- Fixed Code that was broken from last week. Added GenPC and set up everything else (Methods needed,
what will be called in main, blocks of 0s waiting to be filled with numbers).

2/13/18 -- Start with figuring out how to make it work when tunneling is involved. Made a function that sets up
all values to infinity. then calls a recursive function that works in every direction. Finally it exits and prints it out.
Had to keep the weight in mind when tunneling ((hard/85)+1).  After this works pretty easily I got to work on the paths
where things could not dig. For this I just kept in mind that going into a wall is not allowable (so only hardness of 0 is).
Surpisingly, this also worked without much hassle.

FIXED BUG -- Was skipping out on a set of numbers because of their ascii value - fixed due to odd knowledge of ascii quickly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 1.04 -- Scary Monsters!

2/19/18 -- Began the project.  Took PC and let him move around randomly.  Then made methods for the monsters to
follow the shortest path map made last week.  They either look for a smaller number, given if they are a tunneling
monster or not, in that respective array.  They are not the smartest, but move towards the player.

2/20/18 -- Made the method that controls whos turn it is,using an array that controls priority
then lets them take their turn. Added print and sleep to after the player moves.
Also fixed up main so that it would take the number of monsters specificed
and then keep going until the game is over.

Fixed Bug -- If two monsters try to take eachother spots it entered an inf loop.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 1.05 -- Now we're playing (with a keyboard!)

2/23/18 -- Got ncurses in and made that print the dungeon to the screen instead.  Put stairs in the dungeon, and what happens
when you go up or down them.  Redid my gameControl so it would work better with a player controlled by the keyboard. 
Got Monsterlist to open, be correct, and close.

2/24/18 -- Learned how to take inputs from the keyboard. Used this to move the character, show the mosnterlist, and
go up and down the stairs. I changed main because it was getting to be too much.  I need to redo it and will after this 
assignment before we get into C++.  for now just running ./dungeon will get you into the game.

3/1/18 -- Got Monster List to Scroll and 'Quit' Implemented
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 1.06 -- He can teleport!

3/15/18 -- Converted to C++, remade make file.  Everything working fine with make and ./main to play

3/18/18 -- add fog of war map and toggle.  Also added teleporting around the map. Pressing t once will put you in teleport mode.
Pressing it agian will set you down.

3/19/18 -- added random teleporting (must be teleporting first, will randomly set you down.
BUG -- Can teleport out of bounds.

3/20/18 -- BUG fixed. Can no longer tp out of bounds. All is working as expected.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 1.07 -- Adding Monsters

3/26/18 -- Today I added just one bit to main that called a function to read and print out everything. 
first I did the basic checks and then I added all the reading in to variables. FInally I printed all the variables
in the necessary order. That was it!.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 1.08 -- Adding Monsters and Items in the Game

4/2 -- Started. First got all the monsters in the game and working
BUG-- Duplicates of some monsters supposed to be unique.
4/3 -- Then put the items in the game, and the ability to pick them up
BUG FIX -- Duplicates of Monsters fixed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 1.09 -- Using Items

4/9 -- Started. Added all of the items slots to the PC.  Added the commands for items including put on()
takeOff() describe() expunge() dropItem().
BUG -- Again, Duplicates of Items appear often.
BUG FIX -- Items no longer duplicate when adding/dropping etc.
4/10 -- Added updates for the combat and inspectMon(). I also let the player always get the first move. 
This did not always happen before, but not that we are fighing I figured it should.
Added the Boss and Win condition.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 1.10 -- Fleshed out Menu System.

4/13 -- Began The Menu. Made is possible to Go back and forth between screens. 
I then added Rules, Controls, and About information so that others playing
can actually know what to do.  Play will begin the game and Exit will close the game.
BUG -- Big bug involving the game not ending because of the new menu loop system.

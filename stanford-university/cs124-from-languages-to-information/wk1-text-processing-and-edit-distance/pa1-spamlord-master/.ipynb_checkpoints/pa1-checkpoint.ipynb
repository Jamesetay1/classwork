    "In order to make your life easier on this (and future) homeworks, we will be\n",
    "giving you some data to test your code on, which we call a\n",
    "_development set_. Using a development set to test and evaluate your methods\n",
    "is an extremely common approach in natural language processing and machine\n",
    "learning. More generally, coming up with a robust set of test cases to\n",
    "evaluate your work against is also an extremely important part of writing\n",
    "good code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, our development set is a bunch of HTML documents (the personal\n",
    "homepages of some Stanford CS professors) that we've scraped from the web and\n",
    "downloaded for you. If you're not familiar with the details of HTML or its\n",
    "syntax, that's fine. For the purposes of this assignment, all you need to know\n",
    "is that the inputs are text files (with some formatting) that contain the\n",
    "(possibly obfuscated) emails and phone numbers that we want to extract. You can\n",
    "find all of these HTML documents in the ```data/dev``` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the HTML documents, the ```data``` directory also contains\n",
    "another file, ```data/devGOLD```. You can think of this file as the answer key\n",
    "corresponding to the documents in ```data/dev```. It contains all the\n",
    "correctly extracted phone numbers and emails from all the documents in\n",
    "```data/dev```, in a particular format so your scripts (and our grading scripts)\n",
    "can read them easily. The format is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format of Matches\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line in the ```data/devGOLD``` file represents one extracted email address\n",
    "or phone number in the form of a 3-tuple. Each tuple is represented as 3 strings\n",

    "The second string is an 'e' if the match was an email address, or a\n",
    "'p' if it was a phone number.\n",

    "```\n",
    "  user@example.com\n",
    "  650-555-1234\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, the answers in the ```data/devGOLD``` file and the outputs\n",
    "generated by your implementation should take the form of Python tuples\n",

    "\n",

    "so you should aim get 100% of them correct!\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of your grade, worth 8 points, will be based on how well your\n",

    "(and hiding) emails and phone numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third part is a brief section worth 1 point designed to get you thinking about ethical issues surrounding spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're not expected to perform perfectly on the test set as you don't know\n",
    "what is in it, or have the correct answers (just like in real life). As long as\n",

    "fewer.\n",

    "against your classmates (although you won't get any extra points above 24).\n",
